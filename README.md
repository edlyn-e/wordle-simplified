# Project: Wordle-Simplified
### Overview
Can you guess the five letter word in 6 attempts or less? Wordle-Simplified is a Java project inspired by a popular game called 'Wordle'. The idea behind this game is to guess the secret word in 6 guesses or less. The goal of this project is to create a simplified version using Java. 

### Goal 
- Create a simplified version of the Wordle game using Java 

### Criteria
- Recreate a simplified version of the game Wordle to be played in a Java console application
- The game should be able to randomly select a 5-letter word from the provided word list
- The user will be able to enter a guess word that is also 5 characters long
- For each letter, the application will tell the user if that letter is correct, right letter in the wrong position, or wrong letter
- After the user guesses 6 times incorrectly, the game is over and the user loses
- If the user guesses the word correctly, the game is over and the user wins
- Read the word list directly from the file when the application starts
